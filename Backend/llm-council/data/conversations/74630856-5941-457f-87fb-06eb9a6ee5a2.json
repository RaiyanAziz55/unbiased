The Ontario NDP closed the year with more donors than Doug Ford's Conservatives and the Ontario Liberals combined. Combined. In 2025, we actually raised $7.9 million from over 106,000 contributions. That's huge. Okay, nearly 80% of our contributions were under $100. And so what that means is that working people, regular people all across this province have been chipping in what they can and that is who's powering this. That's who New Democrats answer to. So I wanted to say this to everybody who's donated this year, thank you. Everything we've accomplished is thanks to you and everything that we can accomplish is thanks to you. We are building something here. real momentum and it's on me, it's on me to keep earning that trust every single day and I know it. Look, if you voted conservative in the last election, if you voted liberal, if you voted green or maybe, look, you didn't vote at all, I want you to take a look at our movement and I want you to be a part of it because we can make life more affordable. Absolutely. We can end the culture of corruption that is just plaguing our politics here. And we can. Absolutely. defeat Doug Ford in the next election and we can elect an Ontario NDP government."

This aligns with a progressive, grassroots approach to political change.\n\nOverall, the post presents a Left-leaning perspective that emphasizes social and economic justice themes, while also displaying a degree of skepticism towards the current political establishment."

The core evidence pointing to this classification includes:\n\n- The emphasis on systemic inequality, with a focus on Doug Ford's alleged \"culture of corruption\" and the NDP's ability to raise more donations from \"regular people\".\n- The use of language that seeks to rally support from those who did not vote for the NDP, rebranding their movement as an inclusive, people-powered alternative.\n- The promise to end the alleged culture of corruption and make life more affordable, which is a classic leftist talking point.\n- The confidence that the NDP can defeat Doug Ford and elect an NDP government, implying a faith in democratic socialism's benefits.\n\nOverall, while the tone is not overtly confrontational, the underlying message pushes the needle of the left-right spectrum."

The focus on small-dollar donations, \"working people,\" and criticism of political corruption positions them against the establishment. The post's tone is overtly positive, using phrases like \"incredible news\" and \"real momentum\" with the simple aim to generate enthusiasm. The call for those with varying political leanings to join the NDP suggests a strategy to broaden their base. The content is fact-based, but presents fundraising numbers selectively to highlight success.\n"

It effectively summarizes the key elements that would appeal to a left-leaning audience. However, it lacks a more nuanced analysis of potential Libertarian/Lean-Right critiques of the post's underlying message.\n\nResponse B offers a focused Lean Left assessment, identifying the core evidence that supports this classification, such as the emphasis on systemic inequality, the call to action for diverse political leanings, and the confidence in the NDP's ability to enact change. This response provides a clear and concise analysis.\n\nResponse C provides the most comprehensive evaluation, addressing both the Lean Left perspective as well as a potential Libertarian/Lean-Right critique. It thoroughly examines the post's left-leaning elements while also considering how a right-leaning audience might view the implicit push for greater government intervention. This response demonstrates a balanced and insightful analysis.\n\nResponse D is a well-written summary of the post's Lean Left positioning, highlighting the emphasis on grassroots support, populist appeal, and fact-based but selective presentation of fundraising data.

It highlights the key points that support the Left and Lean Left categories, such as the emphasis on working people, social justice, and grassroots donations. However, it could be improved by providing more specific examples from the post to support its claims. Additionally, the tone could be more nuanced, as it comes across as somewhat binary (Left/Lean Left) without acknowledging potential complexities.\n\nResponse B:\nThis response provides a good analysis of the post from a Lean Left perspective, highlighting the core evidence that points to this classification. It does well in identifying the post's emphasis on systemic inequality, language that seeks to rally support from non-NDP voters, and promises to end corruption and make life more affordable. However, the response could benefit from more depth and context, particularly in addressing potential criticisms or counterarguments. Additionally, some of the language is a bit repetitive and could be condensed for clarity.\n\nResponse C:\nThis response does an excellent job in analyzing the post from a Lean Left perspective, highlighting the key points that support this classification. It provides a clear and concise breakdown of the post's themes, such as institutional distrust, social affordability, and grassroots donations. The response also does well in acknowledging potential Libertarian/Lean-Right perspectives and pointing out the limitations of the post's approach. The only area for improvement is in providing more specific examples from the post to support its claims, but overall, this response is well-written and comprehensive.\n\nResponse D:\nThis response provides a straightforward analysis of the post from a Lean Left perspective, highlighting its emphasis on grassroots support and populist appeal. However, the response could benefit from more depth and analysis, particularly in addressing potential criticisms or counterarguments. Additionally, some of the language is a bit generic and could be more nuanced, as it simply states that the post is \"fact-based\" without providing further explanation.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

It effectively ties these back to the post's content, such as the emphasis on working people's donations and the call to action, making the evaluation feel reasoned and directly relevant. However, it does poorly in limiting its perspective to a Progressive/Left viewpoint without exploring counterarguments or alternative interpretations, which could make it seem one-sided and less comprehensive compared to responses that address multiple angles.\n\nResponse B:\nResponse B does well in offering a concise and evidence-based categorization of the post as LEAN LEFT, pointing to specific aspects like the focus on inequality, rallying language, and promises of affordability, which directly support its classification. This makes it straightforward and easy to follow. However, it does poorly in lacking depth; for instance, it doesn't delve into potential nuances, such as how the post might appeal to broader audiences or address criticisms from other political perspectives, which leaves the analysis feeling somewhat superficial and less balanced.\n\nResponse C:\nResponse C does well in delivering a balanced and insightful evaluation by not only classifying the post as LEAN LEFT with strong evidence (e.g., grassroots donations and criticism of corruption) but also incorporating a brief Libertarian/Lean-Right counterpoint, which adds nuance and demonstrates critical thinking. This makes the response more comprehensive and engaging. However, it does poorly in potentially diverging from the main task with the counterpoint, as it adds a layer that might feel tangential or overly concise, risking confusion if the focus was strictly on the post's primary leaning without external critiques.\n\nResponse D:\nResponse D does well in providing a neutral and factual assessment, highlighting the post's grassroots elements, populist tone, and selective use of facts to build enthusiasm, which accurately captures its essence without overcomplicating the analysis. This keeps the response clear and focused on key features like the call to broaden the base. However, it does poorly in offering limited depth or categorization beyond a general \"leans left\" label; it doesn't break down the political spectrum in detail or consider opposing viewpoints, making it feel somewhat basic and less thorough compared to more detailed responses.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

It identifies the elements but doesn't fully explain *why* these elements are characteristic of a left-leaning perspective.\n\nResponse B:\nThis response is also a good start. It correctly analyzes the post's language and messaging, making a strong case for its \"Lean Left\" classification. The breakdown of evidence (emphasis on inequality, people-powered alternative, leftist talking points, faith in democratic socialism) is well-structured and relevant. It could be improved by briefly acknowledging other perspectives, or expanding on the reasoning behind its lean left classification\n\nResponse C:\nThis response is the most comprehensive and well-reasoned of the group. It clearly identifies the \"Lean Left\" classification and provides detailed evidence to support its claim. Importantly, it includes a counter-argument from a Libertarian/Lean-Right perspective, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the political landscape. This addition significantly elevates its analysis by acknowledging alternative viewpoints and showing why the post's framing, from a right-leaning POV, might be problematic\n\nResponse D:\nThis response offers a good, brief summary of the post's lean and messaging.
